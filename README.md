# PostfixAdmin

Integrates with :

 - IMAP/POP3 server (e.g. Dovecot or Courier)
 - Database backend (choose one of: SQLite, MySQL or PostgreSQL)
 - Fetchmail (optional)

## Features

 - Unlimited domains/aliases/mailboxes

 - Integration with Squirrelmail or Roundcube (via plugins)
 - Optional XMLRPC based API

## Hosting Requirements

 - Requires PHP 7.4+
 - Database (MySQL, PostgreSQL or Sqlite)
 - Requires Apache / Nginx webserver (that's capable of integration with PHP)

## Releases

 - While you can install PostfixAdmin from 'git' using the 'master' branch, 'master' is our main development version. It may work. It may contain funky new exciting stuff. It may "eat your data".
 - If you want an easy life, use a published release - see: https://github.com/postfixadmin/postfixadmin/releases or its branch (e.g. postfixadmin_3.3)
 - Latest significant changes should be listed in the appropriate CHANGELOG.TXT file.
 - From 2025/06 we should be using SemVer releases (e.g. 4.0.1-beta1, and not postfixadmin-4.0.1-beta1 for tags etc)
 - Before a new release, try to remember to edit `config.inc.php` and change the version variable. Also update db_min_version in functions.inc.php if there were changes in upgrade.php.

## Development Notes

Github actions is configured to run unit tests, once something is appropriately pushed, or * run `vendor/bin/phpunit tests` (but this will not test against different PHP versions). 

You should be able to use ACT (https://github.com/nektos/act) to run the tests locally, this will require docker etc.

 * `composer format` - should fix styling issues (spaces etc in the code)
 * `composer psalm`  - should detect some obvious errors (e.g. a typo in a function name, referencing an invalid class etc)
